## Dataset-SCICD2K

We constructed an Screen Content Image Compression Dataset (SDU_SCICD2K), encompassing over 2000 screen content images. 

The dataset was divided into three main categories, each containing approximately 700 images. 

The first included text, charts, and graphics, the second consisted of animations, movies, and games, and the third combined NS images with SC images.

The dataset can be downloaded here.
